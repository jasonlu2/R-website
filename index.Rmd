## Bio

I'm a full-time student at the University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'em ðŸ¤˜) studying Statistics and Data Science and pursuing a minor in Computer Science, a BI Analyst at the PGA of America, and was an AI/ML Intern at Fidelity this past summer.

When I'm not grinding school work and work work, I enjoy a bunch of hobbies:  

* Strength training (PRs: 235 bench, 305 squat)
* Bouldering
* Playing competitive video games with my friends and coworkers
* Trying new food
* Playing golf


If wanna learn more about me, check out my personal portfolio, as this is just a little test in creating a website through R.
